- The " <Strong>Excllent Training</Strong>" Training Center of the company "<Strong>Green Building</Strong>" has decided to develop a computer tool that facilitates the tasks of monitoring and evaluating its activities in terms of training.
It is in this context that our project is appropriate. The goal is the design and development of a computer application (Desktop application) that allows managers to better manage training management in order to develop and be more productive.
